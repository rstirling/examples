# How to use Chronos on DC/OS

[Chronos](http://mesos.github.io/chronos/) is still available on DC/OS, representing the original way to run batch jobs. It is a highly-available, distributed job scheduler, providing the a robust way to run batch jobs. Chronos schedules jobs across the DC/OS cluster and manages dependencies between jobs in an intelligent way.

## Prerequisites

- A running DC/OS 1.8 cluster with 1 nodes with at least 2.5GB of RAM and 2 CPU available in the cluster.
- [DC/OS CLI](https://dcos.io/docs/1.9/usage/cli/install/) installed.

## Install Chronos

From the command line, enter this command:

```bash
$ dcos package install chronos
This DC/OS Service is currently in preview. We recommend a minimum of one node with at least 2 CPUs and 2.5GiB of RAM available for the Chronos Service.
Continue installing? [yes/no] yes
Installing Marathon app for package [chronos] version [3.0.1]
Chronos DCOS Service has been successfully installed!

	Issues: https://github.com/mesos/chronos/issues
```

Note that you can specify a JSON configuration file along with the Chronos installation command to customize the setup, like so: `dcos package install chronos --options=<config_file>`. For more information, see the DC/OS CLI [command reference](https://dcos.io/docs/1.9/usage/cli/command-reference/).

Next, validate that Chronos is successfully installed. Go to the `Services` tab of the DC/OS UI and check if Chronos shows up in the list as `Healthy`:

In addition, run this command to view installed services:

```bash
$dcos package list
NAME     VERSION  APP       COMMAND  DESCRIPTION
chronos  3.0.1    /chronos  ---      A fault tolerant job scheduler for Mesos which handles dependencies and ISO8601 based schedules.
```

//TO UPDATE//

## Create a scheduled job

Open the Chronos UI from the DC/OS UI via the `Open Service` button and click the `New Job` link to bring up the form for creating jobs.

![New job form in Chronos](img/new-job.png)

Next, fill in the following values in the form:

- `NAME`: "Date"
- `DESCRIPTION`: "Prints the current date"
- `COMMAND`: `/bin/date`
- `OWNER(S)`: Enter your email address.
- `SCHEDULE`: Enter `T10S` in the `P` field

Note that Chronos uses [ISO 8601 Interval Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals) to describe job schedules, so `T10S` means run this job every 10 seconds.

Now click the `Create` button at the top of the form to submit the job.

Let's verify that our job ran successfully. Run the following CLI command to view all completed tasks:

```bash
$ dcos task --completed ct*
NAME              HOST        USER  STATE  ID
ChronosTask:Date  10.0.3.226  root    F    ct:1478092145000:0:Date:
ChronosTask:Date  10.0.3.229  root    F    ct:1478092135000:0:Date:
ChronosTask:Date  10.0.3.230  root    F    ct:1478091935000:0:Date:
```
Note that the `--completed` argument includes tasks that have completed their execution. Chronos uses the prefix `ct` for all its tasks, so `ct*` filters out Chronos tasks.

To view the output of a task, copy one of the values under the `ID` column in the output of the previous command and use it as the argument to `dcos task log`:

```bash
$ dcos task log --completed ct:1478092145000:0:Date:
